## Unit 3D Tutorial

This is my code repo for following along to the Unity3D tutorial series by Tom Francis. It can be found here on his [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUtKzyIe0aB3TZfe2wsIgJgGZW5G_NAxa).

This will be a slow moving repo and I am probably going to break it a lot as I work through the various videos.

Development platform:
- OS: Mac OS - Big Sur (11.6.1)
- IDE: Visual Studio Code

You will need to install Unity Hub and then one of the available versions of the Unity Engine, which you can get at [www.unity.com](https://www.unity.com)
